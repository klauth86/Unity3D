        This program is in the public domain.

For complete information about the techniques employed in
this program, see the World-Wide Web document:

The xyz_to_rgb() function, which was wrong in the original
version of this program, was corrected by:

        Andrew J. S. Hamilton 21 May 1999

who also added the gamma correction facilities and
modified constrain_rgb() to work by desaturating the
colour by adding white.

A program which uses these functions to plot CIE
"tongue" diagrams called "ppmcie" is included in
the Netpbm graphics toolkit:

(The program was called cietoppm in earlier
versions of Netpbm.)
